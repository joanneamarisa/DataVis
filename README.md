# What flowers bloom in winter?
The Data Garden Project offers a learning syllabus and community for young people to share data-driven stories from their lives and surroundings using creative code.
This file is** a sample from our Module 6 exercise** on publishing your p5.js sketch with GitHub Pages, paired with introductions to a combination of HTML and CSS. 

## The Story
You can use a GitHub README file like this to **write about the journey and rationale of your data viz project**. Starting with the story: What made you choose this topic or theme? Where did the idea come from?

## The Data
Next, we all love to hear about your data of course. What was the dataset you've gathered in the 14 days? What were the methods you used? What did you find out about yourself or your surroundings through the process?

## The Visualisation

Also, why not share the inspirations that led to your specific visualisation? What were some artworks that inspired you? Why did you choose this approach for your visualisation? How does it represent the data and/or you?
Try adding different README elements:
> Maybe an inspiring quote?
* Maybe an inspiring [link](datagardenproject.com)?
* Or [two?](bit.ly/JoinDataGarden)

Why not add a link to your learning document so visitors can see your progress that led you here?

## About You
Finally, you can also share a blurb to the world about who you are â€“ or where we can reach out to you or say hi!
